# Data-Stream-Analyser
Using combinational and sequential logic in building a reliable digital system that detects specific binary messages and responds with the correct action based on the message. This project emphasizes the use of finite state machines, logic gates, flip-flops, and output interface control to build a fully functional sequence detection system.
